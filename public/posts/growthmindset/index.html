I recently completed a course for assistant managers and learned about something called a “growth mindset.” Turns out, I’ve had one all along—I just didn’t know it had a name.
Lessons That Stuck

Challenges = growth.
Feedback isn’t personal—it’s fuel.
Skills improve with effort and repetition.

Growth as a Continuous Process
Repitition leads to improvement and failure is the path to success not the opposite.
External Influences
I remember when I was about 11 years old I made many mistakes playing football in the street with my friends. I was not very good at it, but I loved the game. One of my best friends said that I was really bad at it. That didn&rsquo;t stop me from playing, but it was comments like that which could have discouraged me and unconsciously made me have a fixed mindset when I encountered difficulty at something. Instead, I kept playing and practicing, and eventually I got better. This experience taught me that external influences can shape our mindset, but we have the power to choose how we respond to them.">
