      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently completed a course for assistant managers and learned about something called a “growth mindset.” Turns out, I’ve had one all along—I just didn’t know it had a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-that-stuck&#34;&gt;Lessons That Stuck&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenges = growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback isn’t personal—it’s fuel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skills improve with effort and repetition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure is the path to success not the opposite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;external-influences&#34;&gt;External Influences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was about 11 years old I made many mistakes playing football in the street with my friends. I was not very good at it, but I loved the game. One of my best friends said that I was really bad at it. That didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from playing, but it was comments like that which could have discouraged me and unconsciously made me have a fixed mindset when I encountered difficulty at something. Instead, I kept playing and practicing, and eventually I got better. This experience taught me that external influences can shape our mindset, but we have the power to choose how we respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
