## Hello, I'm Adrian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PowerShell Systems Administrator with a passion for automation and making complex systems work seamlessly. By day, I wrangle servers and craft scripts to make IT operations smoother. When I'm not diving deep into PowerShell or managing infrastructure, you'll find me embracing my most important role - being a dad.

### What I Do

- ðŸ”§ PowerShell automation specialist
- ðŸ’» Systems administration and infrastructure management
- ðŸ¤– DevOps practices and tooling
- ðŸŽ® Avid gamer (when the kids are asleep!)

### Gaming Life

Speaking of gaming, I'm particularly fond of Xcom. It's my way of unwinding after a day of scripting and troubleshooting. There's something satisfying about conquering both technical challenges at work and virtual challenges in games.

### Let's Connect

Feel free to reach out through any of the social links. I'm always happy to discuss PowerShell, sysadmin life, gaming, or share dad jokes!
