# Introduction
<!-- Briefly define what “growth” means to you and why you’re sharing these thoughts. -->

# Growth as a Continuous Process
<!-- Discuss how growth isn’t linear, the importance of patience and persistence. -->

# External Influences
I remember when I was about 11 years old I made many mistakes playing football in the street with my friends. I was not very good at it, but I loved the game. One of my best friends said that I was really bad at it. That didn't stop me from playing, but it was comments like that which could have discouraged me and unconsciously made me have a fixed mindset when I encountered difficulty at something. Instead, I kept playing and practicing, and eventually I got better. This experience taught me that external influences can shape our mindset, but we have the power to choose how we respond to them.

# Mindset Matters
Usually whenever I tried something new that I wanted to be good at I would practice a lot and fail, got frustrated and sometimes feel in the trap of thinking that I would never get good at it. I would push through and got better. I recently learned that this is a common experience. What really has helped me is reading about the Super Mario effect, which is the idea that repitition leads to imrpovement and that failure is the path to success not the opposite. 

Another important aspect of a growth mindset is the belief in yourself and your ability to improve. Recently my mum bought my kids some Tech Deck finger boards for my kids. I was intreged by them, I got curious and watched a video on how to ollie, (I remember what an ollie was from playing the Tony Hawks Pro SKater video game).
