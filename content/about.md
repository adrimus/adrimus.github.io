## Hello, I'm Adrian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Administrator with a passion for automation and PowerShell. By day, I wrangle servers and craft scripts to make IT operations smoother. When I'm not diving deep into PowerShell or managing infrastructure, you'll find me embracing my most important role - being a dad.

### What I Do

- ðŸ”§ PowerShell automation specialist
- ðŸ’» Systems administration and infrastructure management
- ðŸ¤– DevOps practices and tooling
- ðŸŽ® Avid gamer (when the kids are asleep!)

### Gaming Life

Speaking of gaming, I'm particularly fond of Xcom, Sonic the Hedgehog, Infamous, Batman: Arkham Trilogy and Spiderman games. It's my way of unwinding after a day of scripting and troubleshooting. There's something satisfying about conquering both technical challenges at work and virtual challenges in games. Lately I have less time and I have been enjoying Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge.

### Work history - From ActionScript to PowerShell

I started my career as a web / graphic designer. I have always been a creative person and I enjoyed the design aspect of my job, especially creating logos and branding. However, I found myself drawn to ActionScript and Flash development, PHP and MySQL. Years later I decided to make a career change and started as an IT technician in a Primary School. I learned about Active Directory, group policies and OS deployment.

Yada, yada, yada, I ended up working as a technician at a larger company and eventually they opened up a role for me as System Administrator. I discovered PowerShell and found a way to combine my passion for scripting and managing servers and infrastructure.
