## PowerShell

At work I decided to share my knowledge of PowerShell with collegues. This also helped me understand concepts better as I had to dig deeper and really understand what I was talking about. It was fun to do and I also got to improve my presentation and public speaking skills and at the same time offer help and advice.

I have uploaded the slides and code examples in Jupyter Notebooks here: [Follow in GitHub](https://github.com/adrimus/PowerShellFriday)

Every month or so, I share a PowerShell concept that’s practical, teachable, and that I wished someone explained to me sooner on my PowerShell journey. Here’s what we’ve covered so far.
