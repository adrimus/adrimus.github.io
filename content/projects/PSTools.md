Title: 'PowerShell Tools & Scripts'
Description: 'A collection of PowerShell tools and scripts I have developed for various tasks.'
---
Welcome to my collection of PowerShell tools and scripts. These are simple tools I've created with some System Administration tasks in mind. Feel free to explore, use, and modify them as needed.

## PSInfraTools  
A PowerShell module that provides random functions to manage and retrieve information about Windows systems. It includes functions to get Bitlocker keys from Active Directory, Disk usage, check backup status, User bad password attempts, and more.

Even though the module is not completely finished, they have proven to be useful in my daily tasks. I plan to continue adding more functions and improving existing ones. I also experimented with using Gitversion to automatically version the module based on my git history and commit keywords. It was also an opportunity to use Github actions to build and test the functions. I used the Pester framework to write unit tests.
