Welcome to my collection of PowerShell tools and scripts. These are simple tools I've created with some System Administration tasks in mind. Feel free to explore, use, and modify them as needed.

## PSInfraTools  
A PowerShell module that provides random functions to manage and retrieve information about Windows systems. It includes functions to get Bitlocker keys from Active Directory, Disk usage, check backup status, User bad password attempts, and more.
