title: 'üõ†Ô∏è Automating Sophos Uninstall Across Hundreds of PCs‚ÄîWithout Disrupting Users'
---

Migrating from Sophos to Defender for Endpoint came with a major challenge: tamper protection. To tackle it, I built a PowerShell module that interacts with the [Sophos Central API](https://developer.sophos.com/docs/endpoint-v1/1/overview) to disable tamper protection remotely. You can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/adrimus/pssophoscentral).

## TL;DR

This setup saved countless hours, avoided manual intervention, and kept users blissfully unaware‚Äîjust the way it should be. If you‚Äôre facing a similar migration, feel free to explore or fork the modules, I didn't get a chance to finish the module and did not include all the necessary components like paging as I didn't have to deal with more than 200 endpoints. Always happy to connect with others tackling endpoint automation!

## üîß ‚ÄúThe Orchestrator: Control Script‚Äù

Then I created a control script that:

- üîì Disables tamper protection via the API
- üßπ Runs the uninstall script on the target PC
- üìÅ Logs results to a file so each PC is only processed once
- üïí Runs after hours and checks that no user is signed in‚Äîensuring zero disruption

```powershell
Start-Transcript -Path c:\transcript.txt

param (
    # Array of servers to connect to
    $servers = 'C:\POWERSHELL2\MDM\server.txt',

    # Specifies the path to save the results. If the script is interrupted and rerun, it will skip servers that have already been processed.
    $CsvFile = '~\Results.csv',

    # The script file which is executed remotely on computer
    $ScriptFile = '.\Uninstall-Sohpos.ps1',

    # Another CSV file to record connection errors
    $ConnectionErrors = '~\Errors.csv'
)

Import-Module PSSophosCentral -Force

#region API credentials

# Get password for vault
$passwordPath = Join-Path (Split-Path $profile) SecretStore.vault.credential

$password = Import-CliXml -Path $passwordPath

    $token = $response.access_token

    throw "connection error"

$TenantId = $metadata.TenantId
$dataregion = $metadata.dataRegion

if (Test-Path -Path $CsvFile) {
    $csvData = Import-Csv -Path $CsvFile | 
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty PSComputerName -Unique
    $servers = $servers | Where-Object { $_ -notin $csvData }
}

[System.Collections.Generic.List[PSObject]] $Sessions = @()
# Connect to each server and add the session to the $Sessions array list
foreach ($s in $servers) {

    

    $id = $computerHashTable[$s]
    

    if ($null -ne $id) {

## üßº ‚ÄúThe Cleanup Crew: Uninstall Script‚Äù

The uninstall script is designed to cleanly remove Sophos components before the Defender rollout. It checks for the presence of Sophos, attempts to uninstall it, and handles tamper protection gracefully. It also has a timer in place to ensure that the process does not hang indefinitely and keeps trying to uninstall within a 90-second window.

If tamper protection is still active, it will log the status and exit without disrupting the user. It will restart once the uninstall process is complete and there is no user logged in.

```powershell

.SYNOPSIS
Uninstall the Sophos Suite
.DESCRIPTION
This script is intended to be run on the client workstation. It would be executed by the control script which would create a session to each workstation
